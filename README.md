- There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
- 81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
- There is a wide range of the age of the users. Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.
- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.

## Summary
The data shows a high activity of the bike-sharing service in New York in August 2019. The vast majority of trips were made on the very busy island of Manhattan and were made by male users during the morning and evening peak hours.  This means that Citi Bike services are used by employees as an alternative to public transport. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem like a reliable market.  And the main use seems to be focused on morning and evening commutes.

Additional analysis would be helpful:
- comparison of data for different months to determine trends throughout the year.
- including weather data to find the correlation between weather and travel.
- travel start and end locations during morning and evening rush hours to show the flow of traffic between areas during peak hours.
